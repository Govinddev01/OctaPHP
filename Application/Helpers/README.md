# Helpers
A helper function is a function that performs part of the computation of another function and it's designed to speed up and homogenise repetitive tasks, and make your life that much easier.
As a RULE: helpers should only contain functionality that is common but has no special designation under the overall architecture of the application.

please [read the docs here](https://synestergates788.github.io/octaphp.github.io/octaphp_doc_libraries_and_helpers.html) on creating and loading helpers.
