# Libraries
A library is a collection of resources used to develop software. These may include subroutines, classes, values or type specifications.

OctaPHP has its own definition of "library" just like CodeIgniter, in this case it simply calls each third-party application class its own library. 
Despite that, you can include other classes in the same library file, as long as you have at least one class with the same 
name as the library file.

please [read the docs here](https://synestergates788.github.io/octaphp.github.io/octaphp_doc_libraries_and_helpers.html) on creating and loading libraries.
